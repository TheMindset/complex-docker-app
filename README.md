### Documentation

Beanstalk multi-container uses `Dockerrun.aws.json` which under the hood uses `task definition` from the AWS ECS.

So for more information on how to customize the `Dockerrun.aws.json` file. 
Please refer to the [*task definition documentation*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions)
